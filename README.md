## GUI Photo Watermark Editor
Overview
This project was one of the most challenging and experience building I've had so far. It involved deep dives into GUI design, image manipulation, handling user inputs efficiently and reading a lot of documentation. Despite a bit of frustration at times, I'm proud of the end result and feel that I gained valuable experience from this project.

#### I have a couploe of Takeaways from this project:
- Planning the design layout in advance is very important for GUI projects. While functionality is obviously essential, a buggy or poorly designed UI can detract from the overall user experience of the app and actually hurt it's functionality.
- Breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and focusing on them one by one, helped maintain focus and avoid feeling overwhelmed and making the whole code more scrambled than it should be.
- It's important to learn and understand every stage of the project, rather than just copying and pasting code from chatGPT or SOF.
- Struggling is part of the learning process. Taking short breaks (Pomadoro style) and reevaluating when stuck proved to be a valuable strategy for overcoming difficulties.
